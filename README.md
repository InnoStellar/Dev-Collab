# Dev-Collab
Dev-Collab is a prototype where UI/UX designers and developers can work collaboratively on their Products/ Projects. It is an open source software which can be implemented into other websites with the consent of primary developer (Prakshal Jain). To get the consent, please email us to: <a href="mailto:innostellarhelpdesk@gmail.com">innostellarhelpdesk@gmail.com</a>.

<h2>THE CONCEPT</h2>
We have created the multiple user interface for "Collaborative Code", "Collaborative Sketch", "Realtime file sharing" and "Chat and Video call section". The remaining part is only the main page (home page) which connects all these segments of resources together. Herein is an image that explains the same.
